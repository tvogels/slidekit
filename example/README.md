# SVG Slides Demo Project

Installation:

- Install [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [parcel](https://parceljs.org): `npm install -g parcel`

Files:

- `*.svg` are the slides, generated by any vector graphics tool. We recommend [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) (macOS, native) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (web-based, free). The size of the slides is assumed to be 1280 x 720.
- `slides.json` is a processed concatenation of the SVG files generated by [preprocess_slides.py](https://github.com/tvogels/slides/blob/master/preprocess_slides.py). This script has a 'watch' feature.
- `presenter-nodes.md`. Organized by slide name and stage number.
- `index.js` configures the project. You can add plugins here, for example to play videos, embed web content, or to do scripted animations.
- `index.html` lays out the main page. You can change things like the page's background colors here.
- `package.json` lists project dependencies.

Running (dev mode):

- `parcel index.html`. This runs a web-server, so you can access the slides at a local port in your web browser. This watches for changes and auto-reloads
- Click `[P]` to open presenter view (cockpit).

Deployment (for hosting on your website)

- `parcel build index.html -d dist --public-url ${MY_PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX}`
